# An Incremental scheme compiler

A tiny scheme to x86 asm compiler as described in the paper [An Incremental
Approach to Compiler Construction][paper] by Abdulaziz Ghuloum.

## Where do I get started? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Read the first few sections of the [paper] to understand the premise.

There is a mix of [Scheme], C, Rust and x86 assembly here and these are some
good places to start learning them.

- [x86 module documentation](crate::x86) contains links to a few good x86/assembly tutorials.
- [How to C in 2016](https://matt.sh/howto-c) is a pretty good C refresher.
- [The Rust Programming language][book] book is a good place to start learning rust.

Compile the project and run a few sample programs (see README.md or tests)
before diving deep into the code.

The [core module](core) contains the main data types used by the compiler and is
a good place to start reading the code. [parser](parser) implements a scheme
parser using [nom](nom) can be understood independently from the rest of the
project. [immediate](crate::immediate) documents the runtime representation of
the scheme objects. [rt](rt) and [ffi](ffi) describe the runtime nuances like
memory management while [lang](lang) implements language level semantics like
functions and variables.

See [docs](docs) for some additional notes and comments.
